# SLICE Concept

- **SLICE**

  - Each PCB performs a single function
  - This is referred to as a **SLICE** which stands for _Single-function Logic Interface & Controller Element_
  - It has at minimum some onboard controller (processing) and logic (communication) interface along with supporting circuitry (function)
  - **Example:** A temperature sensor PCB with an I2C capable MCU that reads temperature data and applies a control signal to a power switch.
